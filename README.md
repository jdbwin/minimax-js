# MINIMAX
Unbeatable tic-tac-toe computer

JavaScript implementation of Minimax as described here:  
 [Tic Tac Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax)

### SETUP
1 `git clone https://github.com/jdbwin/minimax-js`

2 `yarn`  
<sub>_(lodash, jest)_<sub>

3 `jest spec/test.js`

### FUTURE
I plan to clean up the Minimax function and move it into its own module. I think it would be fun to make this configurable so it can be used by `DumbPlayer`. They can pick the best worst moves!  

GameState is also bugging me. Lots of redudant code in there.
